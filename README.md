# So_Long Project

## Introduction
In this project, the exploration into the graphic programming world takes a deeper dive with the development of a 2D graphical game using the MiniLibX library. It aims to solidify the understanding of graphical functions while creating an engaging and interactive application.

## Objective
The "So_Long" project is focused on building a tile-based game where a player navigates through a map to collect items and find the exit. The map, defined in a file, outlines the play area with walls, empty spaces, collectibles, and an exit point. It portrays the number of moves made on the screen, enhancing the interactive experience.

## Key Concepts
#### Tile-Based Graphics
Tile-based graphics involve using a grid of tiles, where each tile is an individual picture, to construct the game world. It facilitates the creation of complex and detailed environments with a restricted set of graphical components.

#### MiniLibX Library
The MiniLibX library is a gateway to graphic programming in the C language, offering fundamental functions to initiate a window, illuminate a pixel, and manage events like keyboard inputs associated with this window.

### Game Development
Engaging in game development from the ground up compiles various coding competencies including algorithmic thinking, manipulating user inputs, and graphical rendering into a unified, interactive application.

## Mandatory Requirements
Map validation: The project necessitates the inclusion of a function to validate the map, ensuring its closure and the existence of essential elements.
Player Movements: The functionality to control player movements using arrow keys, coupled with a move counter displayed on-screen, is a requisite.
Visual Feedback: Utilizing MiniLibX to offer visual feedback for player's actions forms a crucial part of the project requirements.
